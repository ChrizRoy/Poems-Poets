### A web app giving daily news feed
## About this project
This is a simple static website which shows important news headlines and it is made using html, css and vanilla javascript.Everything was made using pure css and javascript, none of the fancy frameworks like react and bootstrap were used. A free to-use rest api named newsapi is used to get all the news feeds. Anyone who wishes to make applications using newsapi can visit their official site and get the their free api key but if you are planning to use the free plan like me then you can only make 100 api requests in a day and the the articles which are more than a month old will not be there in the search results.
